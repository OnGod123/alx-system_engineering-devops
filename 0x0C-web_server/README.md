# Nginx Server

## Introduction

This repository contains the configuration files and documentation for setting up and managing an Nginx server. Nginx is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy that is known for its stability, efficiency, and low resource consumption.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Nginx: Install Nginx on your server. You can refer to the official Nginx documentation for installation instructions.

## Configuration

### Server Configuration

- **Main Configuration File**: The main configuration file for Nginx is typically located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. This file contains global settings for Nginx, such as worker processes, error logging, and default server blocks.

- **Server Blocks**: Nginx uses server blocks (similar to virtual hosts in Apache) to configure multiple websites or applications on a single server. Server block configuration files are usually stored in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory and symlinked to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` for activation.

### SSL/TLS Configuration

- Nginx supports SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication between clients and the server. SSL/TLS configuration involves generating SSL certificates, configuring HTTPS server blocks, and enabling SSL protocols and ciphers.

### Load Balancing and Proxying

- Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers. Load balancing and proxying configuration involves setting up upstream servers, configuring proxy pass directives, and implementing health checks.

## Usage

### Starting and Stopping Nginx

To start Nginx, run the following command:
